# Caesar Cipher

This cryptography is pretty simple, and it requires nothing but the positioning of the numbers on the alphabet. All you need is a word/sentence, and a number as a key. Also, since
this cipher does not have different ways of encoding/decoding, only one simple file is necessary to do all the proccess.

For example, if you want to hide the word "orange", and you choose 3 as a key, you have to go through each letter of the word, adding 3 positions on the alphabet. So, the
"O on "orange" will be replaced by "R". So:

## Encode/Decode = Word{Letter} + Key{Letter}

In this case, the word "orange" is now "rudqjh".
