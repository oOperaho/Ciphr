# Morse Code

This is like the easiest code to make, since it has nothing but symbols to represent every letter/digit. In this case, regex can be very useful to specificate the items of a string, and how to not read the message wrong.

Everyone knows Morse, but it's more like looking at a table and simple describe each item to form a word, and a sentence. The code i made just assigns all letter to its respective Morse symbol, and then returns it to the label. The most "difficult" part was to avoid the overuse of spaces, because every space has to be replaced by "/", which represents the separation on Morse.

(Yes, i'll add numbers too. I'm just lazy.)
