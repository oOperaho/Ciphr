# Ciphr

I made this in order to study and solve some encryptions, trying to create a encoder and a decoder to each cipher. Inside of the crypto folders, i'll put some explanation about the logic behind the code. My goal is to recreate some of these ciphers, _without googling_.

### Caesar
### Vigenere
### Base64
### Z-Base32
