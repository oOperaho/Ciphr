# Ciphr 


I made this in order to study python and solve some encryptions, trying to create a encoder and a decoder to each cipher. Inside of the crypto folders, i'll put some explanation about the logic behind the code. My goal is to recreate some of these ciphers, _without googling_. I'm using [PyQt5](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/) to make this simple interface.

Each folder here contains a readme that explains the respective cipher, and how you can decode/encode/convert something with it. I can also make a more detailed text about
the ciphers on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@Operaho).
